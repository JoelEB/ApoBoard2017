This is the development repo for the 2017 Apogaea soldering Workshop project, the Propagand-Eye. 

For all final files for tutorials on how to hack your eyeball, please visit [https://github.com/apoboard](https://github.com/apoboard). 

To donate to this project, please send donations to joeleb on Venmo. 

This board uses an Atmega328p microcontroller (the same device in the Arduino Uno) and can be programmed with an FTDI serial adapter and the Arduino IDE. There is a DC/DC boost-converter (the PAM2401) to provide 5 volts from a single AA battery. On board are 10 addressable WS2812 LEDs (the same LEDs used on all Neopixel products). There is also an infrared (IR) transmitter/receiver pair that allows the boards to communicate with one another. A tactile button is also provided to switch through modes.
