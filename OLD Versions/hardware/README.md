This Repo contains EAGLE CAD files for the DIY Interactive Electronics Apogaea PCB.

The system is based on an Atmega328p microcontroller (the same device in the Arduino Duemilanove), and can be programmed with an FTDI serial adapter and the Arduino IDE. There is a DC/DC boost-converter to provide 5 volts from a single AAA battery, a microphone and amplifier, and 3 RGB LEDs that are driven from common PWM channels. There is also a momentary tactile button for user input.

All of these files are developed for free, for Apogaea, and for fun. It is publicly available under the GNU General Public License version 2 (the "GPL License"). For more information, please see: http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html
